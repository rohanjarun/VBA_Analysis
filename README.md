# VBA_Analysis
## Overview of the Project
The intention of this project is to use Microsoft VBA and help Steve Analyze the trends of certain stocks over the course of 2017 and 2018 and to see whether his parents are better of diversifying their money in other assets or to continue with renewal energy. The module had us make a simple/basic VBA code and this challenge aims to improve that code. The goal here is to create a new sheet using the raw dataset of the old 2 sheets and calculate the total volume on a daily basis as well as return rate on a yearly basis for each stock.
